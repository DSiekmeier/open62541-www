Adding server-side methods
======================

This tutorial demonstrates how to add method nodes to the server.

Consider 'examples/server_method.c' in the repository. The examples are compiled if the Cmake option BUILD_EXAMPLE is turned on.

Use an UA client, e.g., UaExpert to call the method (right-click on the method node -> call).
